1 paragraph overview

1 paragraph on how to "build" the project

Creating a program that intakes assignments along with assignment info to fabricate a checklist/schedule for the user.
I think we should go the route where you enter a specific number of assignmnets and this will create a schedule for you

List order of priority, days until due, approximate time to spend on it... maybe a grid format??
